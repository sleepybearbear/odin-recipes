        One of my favorite low-calorie dishes that makes me forget about pasta!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients Required</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>5 zucchini squash, cut into 'noodles' using a spiral slicer or vegetable peeler</li>
        <li>¼ cup minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) jar marinara sauce, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 (7 ounce) container 2% Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>1 pinch Italian seasoning, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol><li>Step 1</li>
            <p>
                Heat the oil in a large saucepan. 
                <br>Add the onions and saute for 3 minutes. 
                <br>Add the peppers and saute for 2 minutes. 
                <br>Add the zucchini and saute 3 minutes before adding the tomatoes, tomato paste, garlic and oregano, basil, thyme, salt and pepper. 
                <br>Cover the saucepan and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes (the longer the better as long as the sauce is not sticky.)
            </p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
            <p>
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). 
<br>Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
            </p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>
                While the sauce cooks, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan. Add the flour into the butter, stir vigorously for 2 minutes. 
                <br>Gradually add the milk, stirring until the sauce thickens. Stir in the cheese, reserving as much as you will want to sprinkle on top of the lasagna. 
                <br>Stir the cheese into the flour and butter mixture until it has melted completely. Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
            </p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
            <p>
                Soak the lasagna noodles in water for 30 seconds.
            </p>
        <li>Step 5</li>
            <p>
                Cover the bottom of the prepared dish with some of the tomato sauce, 
                <br>followed by a layer of the lasagna sheet, and the cheese sauce. 
                <br>Continue layering these ingredients ending with a layer of cheese sauce. Sprinkle the final layer of cheese sauce with nutmeg, salt, pepper, and the reserved cheese.
            </p>
        <li>Step 6</li>
            <p>
                Bake the lasagna 40 to 50 minutes, until the top of the lasagna is golden brown.
